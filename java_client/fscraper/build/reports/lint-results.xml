        summary="TextView should probably be an EditText instead"
        explanation="Using a `&lt;TextView>` to input text is generally an error, you should be using `&lt;EditText>` instead.  `EditText` is a subclass of `TextView`, and some of the editing support is provided by `TextView`, so it&apos;s possible to set some input-related properties on a `TextView`. However, using a `TextView` along with input attributes is usually a cut &amp; paste error. To input text you should be using `&lt;EditText>`.&#xA;&#xA;This check also checks subclasses of `TextView`, such as `Button` and `CheckBox`, since these have the same issue: they should not be used with editable attributes."

It is documented at http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup&#xA;&#xA;By default, this flag is set to `true`. When this flag is set to `true`, application data can be backed up and restored by the user using `adb backup` and `adb restore`.&#xA;&#xA;This may have security consequences for an application. `adb backup` allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. `adb restore` allows creation of application data from a source specified by the user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application itself.&#xA;&#xA;Setting `allowBackup=&quot;false&quot;` opts an application out of both backup and restore.&#xA;&#xA;To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup, and explicitly set `android:allowBackup=(true|false)&quot;`.&#xA;&#xA;If not set to false, and if targeting API 23 or later, lint will also warn that you should set `android:fullBackupContent` to configure auto backup."
